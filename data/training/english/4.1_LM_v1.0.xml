   <studentAnswers><studentAnswer id="LM_4.1.1"> 
	 <response>Using CSMA/CD, if we increase the speed of a network by a factor of 10, the collision domain diameter will decrease by a factor of 10 (about). This is due to the fact that the sender can recognize collisions only during simultaneous sending. And when we increase the transmission speed, we decrease the transmission time for a given distance. 

This will lead to higher among of collision or we should decrease the LAN size.

	 <response>With a speed increased by a factor of 10, the collision domain diameter does decrease by a factor of 1/10 when using the same minimum packet size (e.g. 64 byte with Ethernet). This is because the send does finish much quicker (10 times as quick) while the time the electricity change needs to travel from sender to receiver and backwards remains the same.

-	For a network of 10x higher speed, the bit time is 1/10 and the collision constraint is also 1/10.
-	The above does only cover simple CSMA/CD w/o repeater devices. The usage of repeaters also limits the collision domain and is defined  differently for 10BaseT and 100BaseT

	<studentAnswer id="LM_4.1.7"> 
	 <response>In a CSMA/CD system the sender has to be able to recognize and react to collisions during sending. The minimal frame length is a measurement that stipulates how short a frame is allowed to be that it can travel back and forth through the longest distance between two stations in a network before sending is over. This allows the sender to detect collisions and prepare resending. The variables framelength, networkspeed and maximum distance (collision domain diameter) are dependant on each other.

Therefore, if one increases the speed of a network by a factor of 10, the framelength stays the same and then medium (cable) stays the same, then the collision domain diameter has to decrease by a factor of 10.

	<studentAnswer id="LM_4.1.49"> 
	 <response> Collision Domain Diameter means the maximum length of line between two nodes in the network which you can use in respect to the length of used frames, the sending speed and the fact, that you want to be able to detect any kind of data collision during transmission. If we now increase the speed of transmission with all other factors remaining the same - especially the frame length -, the time of transmission for each node decreases. So there is less time of data frames travelling on the line during which the stations could detect a collision. To keep the function of collision detection, the maximum length of line - a.k.a. the Collision Domain Diameter - in the network has to decrease to the same factor. So an increase of transmission speed from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s - factor 10 - causes a reduction of Collision Domain Diameter to the factor of 10, too. For example, in Ethernet 802.3 this means a reduction from 3000m to 300m.

	 <response>The “collision domain diameter” is the distance two station can have and still detect a collision while sending. It depends on the minimum frame size, the speed of the signal through the medium and the bit rate of the network. If the bit rate increases while nothing else changes in CSMA/CD a frame is transmitted in less time than before. In this time the signal travels a shorter distance thus decreasing the “collision domain diameter”. If the speed of the network increases by a factor of 10 the “collision domain diameter” shrinks by a factor of 1/10

	 <response> If the speed of a network is incremented by a factor of 10, then the collision domain diameter has to be reduced by a factor of 10 in order to still recognize a collision. Thus, there is a trade-off between efficiency and distance.

	 <response> If transmission time t_t two times larger propagation time t_p, the collision at least can be detected by one side (sender or receiver), i.e., t_t &gt;= 2 * t_p. Thus, t_t / t_p &gt;= 2. What more, t_t = D(bits) / f(bit/sec), where D is data amount and f is the transmission frequency. t_p = a * l, where a is the transmission coefficient and l is the wire length. Therefore, we can conclude the equation with D / (f * a * l) &gt;=2. Under the same D, if f is tenfold, then the wire length should become one tenth.

	 <response> We suppose, we start with 10Mb/s and we have as collision domain diameter (CDD) 3 km. In this case, if we mutliply the speed by a factor of 10, the maximal distance between two stations (also collision domain diameter) shrinks by a factor of 10. Instead of 3 km CDD we get 300 m.
