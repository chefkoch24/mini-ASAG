   <questionText>Let us assume that you flip a coin 6 times where the probability of heads (H) showing
up is 0.6. Please arrange the following events in the increasing order of their
likelihood (i.e., least probable → most probable):
● Event A: you see at least three H’s
● Event B: you see the sequence HHHTTT
● Event C: you see exactly three H’s

	 The correct sequence is BCA , where B is the least probable. One of the following justifications should be given:
		● Event B is a subset/part/special case of C, and C is a subset/part/special case of A
		● Event B is more specific/strict than C and C is more specific/strict than A
		● An actual, correct calculation of the probabilities:
		○ P(B) = 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.4 *0.4 = 0.6^3 *0.4^3 = 0.013824 
		○ P(C) = (6 choose 3) * P(B) = 0.27648 
		○ P(A) = P(C) + P(Y=4) + P(Y=5) + P(Y=6) = 1 - P(Y=0) - P(Y=1) - P(Y=2)
		= (6 choose 3) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^3 + (6 choose 4) * 0.6^4 * 0.4^2 +(6 choose 5) *
		0.6^5 * 0.4 + (6 choose 6) * 0.6^6
		= 0.27648 + 15 * 0.020736 + 6 * 0.031104 + 1 * 0.046656
		= 0.8208 
		○ The answer may be rounded to up to 2 decimal places, e.g. P(B) = 0.01 or
		P(B) = 0.014
		○ It is also sufficient to give a formula without the actual calculation, if it is apparent that P(B) less than P(C) less than P(A), e.g. by stating P(C) = 20 * P(B)

	 <response>If probability of heads (H) showing up is 0.6 i.e. P(H) = 0.6 then Probability of Tails = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 i.e. P(T) = 0.4

Event A: you see at least three H’s = sum of probabilities of 3H + 4H +5H + 6H =  0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 +  0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 +  0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 + 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 = 0.216 + 0.1296 + 0.07776 + 0.046656 = 0.470016

Event B: you see the sequence HHHTTT = P(H) x P(H) x P(H) x P(T) x P(T) x P(T) = 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4  = 0.013824

Event C: you see exactly three H’s = P(H) x P(H) x P(H) =  0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 = 0.216

	 <response>N = 6;
Probability to see H -&gt; P(H) = 0.6
The probability of see T is 1-P(H) -&gt; P(T) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4
The probability of see k H's in any order is: P[y=k] = (N,K)(0.6^k) * (0.4^(N-k)), (N,K) represents the number of combinations

Probability of event A = P(A) = probability see at least 3 H's = probability of seeing 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 H's 
So, P(A) = P[y=3] + p[y=4] + P[y=5] + p[y=6] = 0.82

Probability of event B = P(B)
P(B) = P(H)*P(H)*P(H)*P(T)*P(T)*P(T) = (P(H)^3)*(P(T)^3) = 0.014 -&gt; Since we want a specific order we don't consider the combinations;

Probability of event C = P(C)
P(C) = P[y=3] = 0.28

So, ordering the values from the least probable to the most probable we get:
B, C, A

	 <response>Event B -&gt; Event C -&gt; Event A. If we were to draw a decision tree for the six throws, we could count the number of paths that fulfill each condition. Condition B would only have a single path, because it has a precise outcome attached to each of the throws. If we compare events A and C, we will notice that C describes a subset of A, thus having fewer paths to fulfill the condition. Every path with exactly three H’s is included in event A, but the paths that result in 4, 5 or 6 H’s are neglected for event C.

	 <response>Event B: P(X) = 0,6*0,6*0,6*0,4*0,4*0,4 = 0,0138
Event C: P(X = 3) = 0.2765
Event A: P(X &gt;= 3) = 0,2765 + 0,311 + 0,1866 + 0,0467 = 0.8208 

The probability to flip tails corresponds to 40%. Event B is the least common, because when B arrives, A and C also arrive. The other way round it is not always the case (there is only case B). Furthermore, if Event C has arrived, Event A has arrived as well. The other way round is also only conditionally valid here, because event A is also fulfilled if 4 5 or 5 heads are thrown. From this one can conclude that the amount of possible favorable events for 6 coin tosses in the order B, C, A will increase.

	 <response> Event B: probability -&gt; binomial distribution: = 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 = 0.0026
Event C: P(X = 3) = F(6, 0.6, 3)=0.27648
Event A: F(N,p,k) = (N over k) * P^k * (1 - p )^(N-k)  1 - F(6, 0.6, 2) = 0.8208
Event A has the highest probability because the "at least" is the lowest limitation. It can be 3 but also more, not less. The position of the heads and tails are not important.
Event C is less probable than A because here the number of heads has to be 3, not less not more. That's somehow a stricter rule. The position of the heads and tails also are not important.
Event B has the lowest probability because the position of the heads and tails are given. That means the rule is, there have to be exactly 3, not more not less with the position 1,2,3. There have to be exactly 3 tails, not more not less with the position 4,5,6.

     <response_feedback>The given order in the response is correct, but the probability calculation for event B is incorrect. Event B has a specific sequence of 3 heads followed by 3 tails. The probability of event B is 0.6^3 *0.4^3 therefore, 0.013824.</response_feedback>
